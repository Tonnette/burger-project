# burger-project

### Overview

This is a restaurant app where the user types in a type of burger they want to eat. All of their burger choices are listed on the left of the screen.
They can then choose to devour a particular burger, which transfers the burger to the devoured section to the right of the screen.
The user can then choose to delete any of their devoured burgers from the screen.

This burger logger was built using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. 
The app stores every burger in a MySQL database. 

Node and MySQL is used to query and route data, and Handlebars was used to generate the HTML.

This application has been depoloyed using Heroku.
